# Search and Sort

Implement the code for the classes in `app/src/main/java/searchsort`. Do not modify any other code in this project, but feel free to explore.

1. Examine the structure of the search and sort classes. `BinarySearch` and `LinearSearch` extend the `Search` abstract class. `MergeSort` and `QuickSort` classes extend the `Sort` abstract class.

2. Start by implementing the methods in `Util.java`. These utility methods are required in other classes and in the unit tests.

3. You can use and modify the `Main` class to do your own checks.


You can test your code with the following command:
`./gradlew test`
